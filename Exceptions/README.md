## Types of Exceptions

### User-Defined Exceptions

User-defined exceptions are custom exceptions created by the user to handle specific error scenarios in the application.

### Built-in Exceptions

#### Checked Exceptions

Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. They must be either caught or declared to be thrown.

#### Unchecked Exceptions

Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that occur at runtime and are not checked at compile-time. They do not need to be explicitly handled or declared.

## Throw

The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method or block of code. It is used to raise an exception manually.

## Throws

The `throws` keyword is used in method signatures to declare that a method can throw certain exceptions. It is used to delegate the responsibility of handling exceptions to the caller method.

## Finally

The `finally` block contains code that is always executed, whether an exception is handled or not. It is used to release resources or perform cleanup operations.

## Chained Exceptions

Chained exceptions allow an exception to maintain a cause, which is useful for debugging. It helps in identifying the root cause of an exception.
