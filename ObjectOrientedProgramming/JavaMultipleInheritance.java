/*
 * Concept of multiple inheritance:
 * Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an object-oriented concept, where a
 * class can inherit properties of more than one parent class. The problem
 * occurs when there exist methods with the same signature in both the
 * superclasses and subclass. On calling the method, the compiler cannot
 * determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class
 * method gets the priority.
