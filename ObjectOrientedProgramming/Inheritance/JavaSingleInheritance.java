 * Concept of Single Inheritance:
 * Certainly! Letâ€™s dive into the concept of single inheritance in Java.
 * Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
 * that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
 * In the case of single inheritance, a subclass can inherit from only one
 * superclass. This promotes clean and maintainable code by simplifying class
 * hierarchies.
