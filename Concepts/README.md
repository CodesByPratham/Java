# Java Concepts

This README.md provides an overview of fundamental Java concepts, including arrays, ArrayLists, methods, shadowing, type casting, strings, and the Stream API.

## Arrays

Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values of the same data type under a single name. They have a fixed size and are indexed from 0 to (length-1). Arrays can be of primitive data types or objects.

## ArrayLists

ArrayLists in Java are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size dynamically. They are part of the Java Collections Framework and provide methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements. ArrayLists can only store objects, not primitive data types.

## Methods

Methods in Java are blocks of code that perform a specific task and are reusable. They are declared within a class and can be called from other parts of the program. Methods can have parameters and return values, or they can be void.

## Shadowing

Shadowing occurs in Java when a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. In such cases, the inner variable "shadows" the outer variable, making it inaccessible within that scope.

## Type Casting

Type casting in Java is the process of converting one data type into another. It can be either implicit or explicit. Implicit type casting (widening) occurs when converting from a smaller data type to a larger data type, while explicit type casting (narrowing) requires an explicit cast operator and may result in data loss.

## Strings

Strings in Java are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created. Java provides a rich set of methods for manipulating strings, such as concatenation, substring extraction, and searching.

## Stream API

The Stream API, introduced in Java 8, is a powerful tool for processing sequences of elements in a functional and declarative style. It allows developers to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing data with concise and expressive code. Streams can be created from collections, arrays, or other data sources, and support both sequential and parallel operations. Key operations include Intermediate operations and Terminal Operations. The Stream API simplifies data processing tasks, enhances code readability, and supports parallelism, making it a valuable addition to the Java language.
