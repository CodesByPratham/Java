## [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/ObjectOrientedProgramming)

Exploring the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming which form the foundation of Java's structure and modular approach.

### Classes and Objects

- Classes define a blueprint for objects. Objects are instances of classes and encapsulate state and behavior.

### Inheritance

- Inheritance is a mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.

### Polymorphism

- Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, enhancing flexibility in code.

### Abstraction

- Abstraction simplifies complexity by hiding the detailed implementation and showing only the essential features of an object or system.

### Encapsulation

- Encapsulation protects the data in an object from unwanted access by binding the data with the code that manipulates it.

## [Exceptions](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Exceptions)

This section covers the concepts of handling exceptions in Java, ensuring robust and error-free code.

### Types of Exceptions

#### User-Defined Exceptions

- Creating custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios.

#### Built-in Exceptions

##### Checked Exceptions

- Exceptions that are checked at compile-time.

##### Unchecked Exceptions

- Exceptions that occur at runtime and are not checked at compile-time.

### Throw

- The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.

### Throws

- The `throws` keyword is used in method signatures to declare that a method can throw certain exceptions.

### Finally

- The `finally` block contains code that is always executed, whether an exception is handled or not.

### Chained Exceptions

- Chained exceptions allow an exception to maintain a cause, which is useful for debugging.

## [Multithreading](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Multithreading)

This section explores multithreading concepts in Java, enabling concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU.

### Basics of Multithreading

- Understanding the core concepts of multithreading, including its advantages and basic structure.

### Two Ways to Use Multithreading

- Implementing multithreading using the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.

### Thread Priorities

- Managing thread priorities to influence the order of thread execution.

### Thread States

- Exploring the lifecycle of a thread and various thread states such as new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed waiting, and terminated.

### Main Thread

- Understanding the main thread in Java and how it controls the execution of a program.

### Thread Methods

- Using important thread methods such as `start()`, `run()`, `sleep()`, `join()`, `yield()`, and others for thread management.

## [Generics](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Generics)

This section introduces the concept of generics in Java, which allows for type-safe operations and code reusability.

### What are Generics?

Generics are a feature in Java that enable you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for the type they operate on. This placeholder, known as a type parameter, allows for flexible and reusable code.

### Benefits of Generics

1. **Type Safety**:

   - Generics provide compile-time type checking and help catch type-related errors early, reducing the risk of runtime exceptions.

2. **Code Reusability**:

   - Generics allow you to write a single class or method that can handle multiple types, avoiding the need for code duplication.

3. **Elimination of Casts**:
   - By using generics, explicit type casting is unnecessary, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

### How Generics Work

#### Type Parameters

Generics use type parameters to specify the type of data a class, interface, or method will operate on. These parameters are defined within angle brackets (`<>`) and allow for type-safe operations.

#### Generic Classes

A generic class is a class that can operate on any type specified by a type parameter. This allows for the creation of versatile and reusable components.

#### Generic Methods

Generic methods are methods that use type parameters and can handle different types. They enable methods to perform operations on various types without needing multiple implementations.

#### Wildcards

Wildcards (`?`) represent an unknown type and provide flexibility in working with different types while maintaining type safety.

## [I/O Streams](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Streams)

I/O (Input/Output) streams in Java are used to handle reading and writing data. They provide a standardized way of processing data from different sources like files, memory, and the console.

### Input Streams

- **InputStreamReader**: Reads bytes and decodes them into characters. It’s a bridge between byte streams and character streams. Ideal for reading text data.
- **FileReader**: A specialized class for reading character files. It reads the content from a file and converts it into characters.

### Output Streams

- **OutputStreamWriter**: Encodes characters into bytes. It’s a bridge between character streams and byte streams. Used to write text data.
- **FileWriter**: A specialized class for writing character files. It writes the content to a file as characters.

### Readers

- **BufferedReader**: A wrapper around a Reader class that adds buffering capabilities. It reads large chunks of data at once, improving efficiency. Useful for reading text from input streams like files or the console.

### Writers

- **BufferedWriter**: A wrapper around a Writer class that adds buffering capabilities. It writes large chunks of data at once, reducing the number of I/O operations. Useful for writing text to output streams like files.

### File Handling

- **File Class**: Represents file and directory paths. You can use it to create, delete, or check the properties of files and directories.
- **FileReader and FileWriter**: Used for handling files at the character level. These classes allow reading and writing characters to and from files.

## [JDBC Concepts](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/JavaDatabaseConnectivity)

This section covers **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**, a core API for Java applications to interact with relational databases. JDBC enables executing SQL queries, updating data, and managing database connections seamlessly.

### Key Concepts
- **JDBC Architecture**: 
   Consists of three layers:
   1. **Application Layer**: Issues SQL queries.
   2. **Driver Manager Layer**: Manages communication between the Java application and the database drivers.
   3. **Database Layer**: The physical storage of data.

- **Types of JDBC Drivers**:
   - **Type 1 (JDBC-ODBC Bridge)**: Translates JDBC to ODBC, limited in performance.
   - **Type 2 (Native API Driver)**: Uses native database APIs, offering better performance but less portability.
   - **Type 3 (Network Protocol Driver)**: Interacts via a middleware server, suitable for web applications.
   - **Type 4 (Thin Driver)**: Pure Java driver that connects directly to the database, providing optimal performance.

### JDBC Programming Workflow:
Key steps include loading the driver, establishing a database connection, executing SQL queries, processing the results using a ResultSet, and properly closing the connection.

### Additional Topics:
- **PreparedStatement and CallableStatement**: 
   - **PreparedStatement** improves efficiency for repeated queries.
   - **CallableStatement** is used for executing stored procedures in the database.

- **ResultSet Interface**: 
   Used to navigate and process query results returned from the database.

- **Transaction Management**: 
   Ensures consistency of data using ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), along with `commit` and `rollback` operations to control transaction flow.

- **Error Handling**: 
   JDBC uses `SQLException` to handle database errors, providing insights into the error's cause and state.

## [Java Server Pages](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/JavaServerPages)

JSP is a server-side technology that enables developers to create web pages with dynamic content by embedding Java within HTML. It simplifies web development compared to Servlets by providing a more readable and maintainable structure.

### JSP API & Lifecycle
JSP follows a lifecycle consisting of initialization (`jspInit()`), request processing (`_jspService()`), and destruction (`jspDestroy()`). This ensures efficient memory management and request handling.

### JSP Implicit Objects
JSP provides built-in objects like `request`, `response`, `session`, and `application`, which help manage user input, output, and session tracking without requiring explicit instantiation.

### JSP Directives
Directives in JSP define page-level settings. The `page` directive configures the JSP environment, the `include` directive inserts external content, and the `taglib` directive allows the use of custom tag libraries.

### JSP Actions
JSP actions like `<jsp:include>`, `<jsp:forward>`, and JavaBean operations (`<jsp:useBean>`, `<jsp:setProperty>`, `<jsp:getProperty>`) help manage dynamic content, request forwarding, and JavaBean interactions.

### JSP Session Tracking
JSP provides `HttpSession` for maintaining user-specific data across multiple pages. Cookies can also be used to store small amounts of client-side data for tracking user preferences.

### JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL)
JSTL simplifies JSP coding by providing tags for core operations (`c:` for loops and conditions), formatting (`fmt:` for dates and currency), and functions (`fn:` for string manipulation).

### JSP Custom Tags
Custom tags allow the creation of reusable components for JSP. These tags are defined in a Tag Library Descriptor (TLD) file and used in JSP pages, improving code modularity and reusability.
