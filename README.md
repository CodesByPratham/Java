## [Collection Framework](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/CollectionFramework)

This section covers various aspects of the Collection Framework in Java, including classes like Arrays, Collections, Lists, Maps, Queues, and Sets.

### Arrays Class

- Implementation and manipulation of arrays using Java's Arrays class methods.

### Collections Class

- Utilizing the Collections class for operations on collections such as sorting, searching, etc.

### Lists

- Working with List interfaces and implementations like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.

### Maps

- Utilizing Map interfaces and implementations such as HashMap, TreeMap, etc., for key-value mappings.

### Queues

- Implementing Queue data structure using Java's Queue interface and related classes like LinkedList, PriorityQueue, etc.

### Set

- Understanding and utilizing Set interfaces and implementations like HashSet, TreeSet, etc., for storing unique elements.

## [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/ObjectOrientedProgramming)

Exploring the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming which form the foundation of Java's structure and modular approach.

### Classes and Objects

- Classes define a blueprint for objects. Objects are instances of classes and encapsulate state and behavior.

### Inheritance

- Inheritance is a mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.

### Polymorphism

- Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, enhancing flexibility in code.

### Abstraction

- Abstraction simplifies complexity by hiding the detailed implementation and showing only the essential features of an object or system.

### Encapsulation

- Encapsulation protects the data in an object from unwanted access by binding the data with the code that manipulates it.

## [Basic Programming Concepts](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Concepts)

This section delves into fundamental Java concepts, providing explanations and examples for better understanding.

### Arrays

- Basic operations on arrays, including declaration, initialization, and manipulation.

### ArrayLists

- Working with ArrayLists, including adding, removing, and accessing elements dynamically.

### Methods

- Understanding methods in Java, including method declaration, invocation, and parameter passing.

### Shadowing

- Explaining variable shadowing in Java and its implications.

### Type Casting

- Covering type casting in Java, including implicit and explicit casting.

### Strings

- Operations on strings in Java, such as concatenation, substring, etc.

## [Exceptions](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Exceptions)

This section covers the concepts of handling exceptions in Java, ensuring robust and error-free code.

### Types of Exceptions

#### User-Defined Exceptions
- Creating custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios.

#### Built-in Exceptions

##### Checked Exceptions
- Exceptions that are checked at compile-time.

##### Unchecked Exceptions
- Exceptions that occur at runtime and are not checked at compile-time.

### Throw
- The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.

### Throws
- The `throws` keyword is used in method signatures to declare that a method can throw certain exceptions.

### Finally
- The `finally` block contains code that is always executed, whether an exception is handled or not.

### Chained Exceptions
- Chained exceptions allow an exception to maintain a cause, which is useful for debugging.

## [Multithreading](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Multithreading)

This section explores multithreading concepts in Java, enabling concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU.

### Basics of Multithreading

- Understanding the core concepts of multithreading, including its advantages and basic structure.

### Two Ways to Use Multithreading

- Implementing multithreading using the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.

### Thread Priorities

- Managing thread priorities to influence the order of thread execution.

### Thread States

- Exploring the lifecycle of a thread and various thread states such as new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed waiting, and terminated.

### Main Thread

- Understanding the main thread in Java and how it controls the execution of a program.

### Thread Methods

- Using important thread methods such as `start()`, `run()`, `sleep()`, `join()`, `yield()`, and others for thread management.

## [Generics](https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Generics)

This section introduces the concept of generics in Java, which allows for type-safe operations and code reusability.

### What are Generics?

Generics are a feature in Java that enable you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for the type they operate on. This placeholder, known as a type parameter, allows for flexible and reusable code.

### Benefits of Generics

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Generics provide compile-time type checking and help catch type-related errors early, reducing the risk of runtime exceptions.

2. **Code Reusability**:
   - Generics allow you to write a single class or method that can handle multiple types, avoiding the need for code duplication.

3. **Elimination of Casts**:
   - By using generics, explicit type casting is unnecessary, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

### How Generics Work

#### Type Parameters

Generics use type parameters to specify the type of data a class, interface, or method will operate on. These parameters are defined within angle brackets (`<>`) and allow for type-safe operations.

#### Generic Classes

A generic class is a class that can operate on any type specified by a type parameter. This allows for the creation of versatile and reusable components.

#### Generic Methods

Generic methods are methods that use type parameters and can handle different types. They enable methods to perform operations on various types without needing multiple implementations.

#### Wildcards

Wildcards (`?`) represent an unknown type and provide flexibility in working with different types while maintaining type safety.
