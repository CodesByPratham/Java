## <a href="https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/CollectionFramework">Collection Framework</a>

This section covers various aspects of the Collection Framework in Java, including classes like Arrays, Collections, Lists, Maps, Queues, and Sets.

### Arrays Class

- Implementation and manipulation of arrays using Java's Arrays class methods.

### Collections Class

- Utilizing the Collections class for operations on collections such as sorting, searching, etc.

### Lists

- Working with List interfaces and implementations like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.

### Maps

- Utilizing Map interfaces and implementations such as HashMap, TreeMap, etc., for key-value mappings.

### Queues

- Implementing Queue data structure using Java's Queue interface and related classes like LinkedList, PriorityQueue, etc.

### Set

- Understanding and utilizing Set interfaces and implementations like HashSet, TreeSet, etc., for storing unique elements.

## <a href="https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/ObjectOrientedProgramming">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</a>

Exploring the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming which form the foundation of Java's structure and modular approach.

### Classes and Objects

- Classes define a blueprint for objects. Objects are instances of classes and encapsulate state and behavior.

### Inheritance

- Inheritance is a mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.

### Polymorphism

- Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, enhancing flexibility in code.

### Abstraction

- Abstraction simplifies complexity by hiding the detailed implementation and showing only the essential features of an object or system.

### Encapsulation

- Encapsulation protects the data in an object from unwanted access by binding the data with the code that manipulates it.

## <a href="https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/Concepts">Basic Programming Concepts</a>

This section delves into fundamental Java concepts, providing explanations and examples for better understanding.

### Arrays

- Basic operations on arrays, including declaration, initialization, and manipulation.

### ArrayLists

- Working with ArrayLists, including adding, removing, and accessing elements dynamically.

### Methods

- Understanding methods in Java, including method declaration, invocation, and parameter passing.

### Shadowing

- Explaining variable shadowing in Java and its implications.

### Type Casting

- Covering type casting in Java, including implicit and explicit casting.

### Strings

- Operations on strings in Java, such as concatenation, substring, etc.

## <a href="https://github.com/Prathamr-codes/Java/tree/main/SolvedProblems">Solved Problems</a>

This section presents solved problems demonstrating the application of Java concepts in real-world scenarios.

### Arrays

- Solved problems involving arrays, including searching, sorting, etc.

### Conditional Loops

- Solved problems utilizing conditional loops like if, else, switch, etc.

### Methods

- Solved problems demonstrating the use of methods to solve specific tasks.
