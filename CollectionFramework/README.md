# Collection Framework in Java

The Collection Framework in Java provides a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects. It includes interfaces, implementations, and algorithms to work with collections efficiently. This README.md provides a brief overview of key concepts within the Collection Framework.

## Array Class

The `java.util.Arrays` class provides utility methods for working with arrays in Java. It includes methods for sorting, searching, comparing, and filling arrays. These methods simplify common tasks related to array manipulation and enhance productivity.

## Collections Class

The `java.util.Collections` class contains various static methods for operating on collections. It provides algorithms for sorting, searching, shuffling, reversing, and synchronizing collections. Additionally, it includes methods for obtaining synchronized versions of collection objects, making them thread-safe.

## Lists Interface

The `java.util.List` interface represents an ordered collection (sequence) of elements. It extends the `Collection` interface and provides methods for accessing elements by index, adding, removing, and updating elements. Common implementations of the List interface include `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and `Vector`.

## Maps Interface

The `java.util.Map` interface represents a mapping between keys and values. It does not extend the `Collection` interface but is an essential part of the Collection Framework. Maps do not allow duplicate keys and provide methods for adding, removing, and retrieving key-value pairs. Common implementations of the Map interface include `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`.

## Queues Interface

The `java.util.Queue` interface represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Queues typically follow the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) ordering principle. It extends the `Collection` interface and provides methods for adding, removing, and inspecting elements. Common implementations of the Queue interface include `LinkedList` and `PriorityQueue`.

## Set Interface

The `java.util.Set` interface represents a collection that contains no duplicate elements. It extends the `Collection` interface and provides methods for adding, removing, and testing set membership. Common implementations of the Set interface include `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, and `LinkedHashSet`.
